# Fork of https://github.com/fieldOfView/Cura-CustomJobPrefix

Adds ability to insert random string (10 hex digits) and omit base name of job.

# Motivation
My printer allows only names not more than 20 chars in length, I don't reuse files on printer, so I wanted to make cura name file randomly.
I found this plugin, and wanted to use time instead of random string, but because of insertion of original name result was too long and I had to rename it manually.
... I've made this fork.



# Cura Custom Printjob Naming

This plugin lets the user customise the prefix and postfix for print jobs (gcode files) on a per-printer basis. It also lets the user set a folder to save files to, for selected outputs such as the removable drive output device.

Formerly known as Custom Printjob Prefix.
